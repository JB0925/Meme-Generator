This app is a meme generator. Upon first sight, the screen looks fairly empty. Click on the hamburger menu at the top right. A sidebar will pull out. You have two choices: click to read the directions, or click to view the form used to create the memes. The directions explain what to enter into the form, in case it wasn't clear. Then, enter your information into the form fields. Select your text color based on the background color of your image. Submit the form, and watch as your memes begin to fill up the page! To remove a meme, click the radio input below each meme.
